"""SOLAR_STORAGE intra-period discharge gate (shadow-price).

Extends the SOLAR_EXPORT gate (#187,
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-solar-export-discharge-rate-design.md) to
SOLAR_STORAGE (#318). The optimizer plans power=0 (hold) for SOLAR_STORAGE
periods, mapping to load_first + discharge_rate=0. But discharge_rate=0 is a
hardware register that blocks the battery from covering an intra-period
solar/load deficit (e.g. an unforecast EV-charging session) even when SOC is
well above Min SOC. Whether the battery SHOULD cover the dip is the same
economic question #187 answered for SOLAR_EXPORT: cover from battery only
when the stored energy is worth less than buying from grid right now, i.e.

    buy_price * efficiency_discharge >= shadow_price

where shadow_price is the DP value-function gradient dV/dSoE (marginal
opportunity value of stored energy), persisted per period on DecisionData.
During genuine reserve accumulation shadow_price is high (gate stays closed,
protecting the evening target); near a full battery or with ample future
solar, shadow_price drops toward sell price and the gate opens.
