"""Tests for #282 (Approach 1 of #276): replacing
`_best_action_at_continuous_state`'s per-period grid search with breakpoint
enumeration over the *hardware-achievable* action space, per
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-dp-continuous-action-reformulation-design.md.

These reproduce the exact (t, soe) cells the design doc's prototype measured
on `historical_2024_08_16_high_spread_no_solar`: at an off-grid SoE (not an
exact multiple of SOE_STEP_KWH -- what Step 2 actually encounters after real
state transitions), the coarse fixed-step POWER_STEP_KW grid search finds a
worse action than the best one really available. Postmortem (#282): the
first version of this fix searched the truly continuous action space and
found exact analytic breakpoints, which improved on the coarse grid but
broke plan-faithfulness (R == P) -- real hardware only executes discharge
at an integer percent of max_discharge_power_kw
(core/bess/simulation/inverter_simulator.py::_map_rates), so a genuinely
continuous "optimum" like -7.505 kW (out of 10 kW max) is not actually
achievable; execution silently rounds it to 75% (7.5 kW), diverging from
the plan. The fix enumerates the discrete hardware-percent grid directly,
which is both exact with respect to the *true* action space and always
executable exactly as planned.
